# Learning log for Node.js in 2017

This is my personal learning log for learning Node.JS starting April 2017. In this README file, I'll include both resources and a daily log of my accomplishments, inspired by the weekly learning objectives and Agile reviews I did at Makers Academy.


## Day 2 - Thurs 27th April 2017

The goal for today is to try and complete the whole tutorial. My motivation level is high and apart from the one or two meetings, I have most of today to focus on this one goal.

I've managed to complete the tutorial, and have created the basic CRUD single page application for storing movie titles and descriptions. The tutorial covered the basics of the MEAN stack, of which I was already familiar with MongoDB having used it at work and also completed a MongoDB University course, and also AngularJS which we covered at Makers Academy.

I thoroughly recommend this course for revisiting the basics, as the author goes into some depth to try to explain all parts of the code. Now my plan is to look for further tutorials/courses to build other applications in MEAN stack. I don't feel quite ready to build an application on my own yet.


## Day 1 - Wed 26th April 2017

Created this repo, and asked on Maker's slack forum for best tutorials for learning MEAN stack. I also googled and came across a recommendation for Bossable's MEAN stack tutorial from Quora, however it dates back to late 2015 and I ran into major trouble getting meanjs installed. meanjs doesn't appear to support the latest Node version 7.9, and it's github page is at 73% coverage and has outdated dependencies. 

So back to finding a more up-to-date tutorial. The tutorial I've started is at [Udemy](https://blog.udemy.com/node-js-tutorial/). Managed to complete steps 1 and 2, creating an API with Express pulling data from MongoDB. I spent a lot of time in the terminal configuring my macbook and troubleshooting failing npm installations, plus other distractions at work contributed to a slow start.
