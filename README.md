# Learning log for Node.js in 2017

This is my personal learning log for learning Node.js starting April 2017. In this README file, I'll include both resources and a daily log of my accomplishments, inspired by the weekly learning objectives and Agile reviews I did at Makers Academy.

##Day 1 - Wed 26th April 2017

Created this repo, and asked on Maker's slack forum for best tutorials for learning MEAN stack. I also googled and came across a recommendation for Bossable's MEAN stack tutorial from Quora, however it dates back to late 2015 and I ran into major trouble getting meanjs installed. meanjs doesn't appear to support the latest Node version 7.9, and it's github page is at 73% coverage and has outdated dependencies. 

So back to finding a more up-to-date tutorial.
