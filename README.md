# Learning log for Node.js in 2017

This is my personal learning log for learning Node.js starting April 2017. In this README file, I'll include both resources and a daily log of my accomplishments, inspired by the weekly learning objectives and Agile reviews I did at Makers Academy.


## Day 2 - Thurs 27th April 2017

The goal for today is to try and complete the whole tutorial. My motivation level is high and apart from the one or two meetings, I have most of today to focus on this one goal.





## Day 1 - Wed 26th April 2017

Created this repo, and asked on Maker's slack forum for best tutorials for learning MEAN stack. I also googled and came across a recommendation for Bossable's MEAN stack tutorial from Quora, however it dates back to late 2015 and I ran into major trouble getting meanjs installed. meanjs doesn't appear to support the latest Node version 7.9, and it's github page is at 73% coverage and has outdated dependencies. 

So back to finding a more up-to-date tutorial. The tutorial I've started is at [Udemy](https://blog.udemy.com/node-js-tutorial/). Managed to complete steps 1 and 2, creating an API with Express pulling data from MongoDB. I spent a lot of time in the terminal configuring my macbook and troubleshooting failing npm installations, plus other distractions at work contributed to a slow start.
